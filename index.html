    <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong> was born January 17, 1706, died April 17, 1790. Father Josiah Franklin and mother Abiah Folger birthed him
    in Boston Massachusetts. An inventor, polymath, newspaperman, physicist, chess player, musician, writer, and the 6th president
    of Pennsylvania (Oct. 18 1785 - Nov. 5, 1788). He was highly decorated in science, politics, and the founding ways of what it
    meant to have colonial unity and how to be a true American. He owned slaves, but became weary in 1750 arguing against the
    economic casualties of the use of them making him an abolitionist also. This man’s life was more than colorful, touching
    everything from Freemasonry to being the first US Postmaster General, the first U.S. ambassador to France. Signer of the
    Constitution and Declaration of Independence, he also made a splash in writing under the alias “Richard Saunders,” with the
    “Poor Richard’s Almanack.” Even working with the physicist Leonhard Euler to study the theory of light. There is more
    information than can be put in one webpage! He’s the face of the 2nd to highest bill in our country but was never a
    US president. Benjamin represented what was called “Generic religion” he was religious in a sense of acting and being.
    Not belonging to a church or certain faction, he was accepted by all. It’s something I highly agree with because these days
    there are as many churches and views as there are gangs. This man was completely different, an American Michelangelo or
    Da Vinci if you will. He achieved a generation of some mens work in one lifetime through hard work and perseverance.
    I love his attitude and ability to plan and execute, he would write down a schedule for the day and do his best to achieve
    all daily goals with military precision.

      Honestly I didn’t know where to begin or end with this man's life, he was more than interesting. Ben Franklin was one of
      our “Founding fathers” and my favorite one of all time. So this is my tribute to him. Hope you enjoyed your time here and
      drop by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and read up more on him if you have the chance!
